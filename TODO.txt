BUGS
-Central 1-2 beams of IM Lup test show that the debias_stokes produces HIGHER POLI values than the original file.  All debiased values should be lower
- _CDF is never called
- _PPF is never called
-Should infer_P0 be _infer_P0?

QUESTIONS
- _maxP() says "Function to minimize," but it actually returns a single value...I think...?  
- _maxP() uses minimize(), but _nL doesn't use minimize()
-How does _infer_dP0 work?
-How does _get_interp_P0 work?
# Check shapes:
  -How would SNR_obs.shape ever != cube_Q.data.shape ?
  -Why do you turn SNR_obs into an array if SNR_obs.ndim != 3 ?
-Why do you use args in minimize(), and what does it do?

TODO
-Implement primary beam correction
-Group functions based on whether they're related to Vaillancourt or Wardle & Kronberg
-Make it installable by conda
-Run it within iPython (so that my PYTHONPATH works)
-Two TODO statements from Rich already in the code
-Remove dependence on gofish?
-Remove the two debiasing options and make "most probable" the only one?
