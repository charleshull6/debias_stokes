BUGS
-Central 1-2 beams of IM Lup test show that the debias_stokes produces HIGHER POLI values than the original file.  All debiased values should be lower
-Implement spelling corrections from submitted change request (Useage, Stoke, interpoalte, interp1d_kwrgs, etc.)

TODO
-Make it installable by conda
-Run it within iPython (so that my PYTHONPATH works)
-Implement primary beam correction
-Two TODO statements from Rich already in the code

QUESTIONS
-Remove dependence on gofish?
-Remove the two debiasing options and make "most probable" the only one?
